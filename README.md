- 👋 Hi, I’m @ali-raphael
- 👀 I’m interested in ... public policy & voting related python projects!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... more about data visualization :D
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... someone teach me how to web scrape oh my goodness
- 📫 How to reach me ... messages which I will check whenever I'm not obsessing over another project.

Current projects:
~ Using state-level voter data to try to figure out if people who register around the time of big, progressive state initiates are more likely to 
vote when that initiative gets passed.
~ Embroidery of Snorlax with Teddiursa on his belly.
